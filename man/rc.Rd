\title{Robust Circle Fitting Using the RANSAC Algorithm}
\usage{
rc(data, n, k, t, d)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing at least the columns `x`, `y`, and `z`, representing the 3D coordinates of the points.}

\item{n}{An integer specifying the minimum number of points required to fit a model (typically 3 for a circle).}

\item{k}{An integer indicating the maximum number of iterations allowed in the RANSAC algorithm.}

\item{t}{A numeric threshold value to determine whether a point fits the model (distance tolerance).}

\item{d}{An integer specifying the minimum number of inliers required to consider a model valid.}
}
\value{
A list representing the best-fit circle model with components `par` (center x, y, and radius), and `height` (mean z-value of the input points).
}
\description{
This function implements the RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) algorithm to robustly fit a circle to 2D spatial point data (typically x and y coordinates of tree cross-sections), and estimates the average height (z) of the detected shape.
}
\details{
The function uses a custom fitting method `fitSS()` to estimate the parameters of a circle from sampled inliers. The model with the lowest average residual error is selected. The mean height (`z`) of all input points is returned as an additional attribute.
