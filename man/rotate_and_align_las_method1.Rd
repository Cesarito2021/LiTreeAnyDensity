\title{Rotate and Align LAS Point Cloud (Method 1: Ground-Based PCA)}
\usage{
rotate_and_align_las_method1(mesh, crs_code = 3035)
}
\arguments{
\item{mesh}{A mesh object containing vertex data, expected to have a component \code{vb} with 3D coordinates.}

\item{crs_code}{EPSG code for the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) to assign to the LAS object. Default is 3035.}
}
\value{
A LAS object with rotated and vertically aligned coordinates, with CRS and classification fields assigned.
}
\description{
This function rotates a 3D mesh represented by a LAS point cloud object so that its lowest surface points
are aligned with the vertical (Z) axis. It applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the lowest 5th percentile
of elevation values to estimate the ground normal, then uses Rodrigues' rotation formula to align the point cloud.
}
\details{
This method is suited for terrestrial or ground-based point clouds where the lowest points are assumed to represent
the ground. It uses PCA on these points to determine the dominant plane and rotates the point cloud accordingly.
