\title{Filter LAS Points Within the Central Area}
\usage{
filter_las_central_area(las, margin_pct = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{las}{A LAS object containing 3D point cloud data with X and Y coordinates.}

\item{margin_pct}{A numeric value between 0 and 0.5 indicating the percentage of the range to exclude from each side (default is 0.05).}
}
\value{
A LAS object containing only the points within the central XY area defined by the margin.
}
\description{
This function filters points in a LAS object to retain only those located within a central area,
excluding a specified margin percentage from the edges in the XY plane.
}
\details{
The function calculates the XY extent of the LAS points, defines a reduced central area by removing margins
proportional to \code{margin_pct} from all sides, and returns the subset of points falling within this area.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  las_center <- filter_las_central_area(las_object, margin_pct = 0.1)
}
}
